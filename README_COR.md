The ESIPFED mmiorr repository is the source for ESIP Federation's 
Community Ontology Repository Prototype deployment. 
It is a fork of the [mmisw/mmiorr repository](http://github.com/mmisw/mmiorr), 
which runs MMI's Ontology Registry and Repository at http://mmisw.org.

This fork will for the most part be kept in sync with the upstream parent, 
but will have a few files customized for ESIP Federation use.

The master repository for managing and organizing technical content will be
http://github.com/ESIPFed/cor.
